# Rock-Paper-and-Scissor
This is a Rock Paper Scissors game, which I created with python. 

Rock Paper Scissors is a common childhod game which is played between two persons.

You have the luxurt to pick between rock, paper, or scissors. It must be picked simultaneously with the person you are playing with.

The rule of the game is that:
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper

Anything apart from rock, paper or scissors is invalid
